UECS 2453 PROBLEM SOLVING WITH DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS
## Introduction
This project focuses on enhancing search algorithms, including Sequential Search, Binary Search, and Hashing, for efficiently navigating large datasets of URLs. The goal is to optimize search performance and accuracy while handling a file containing 550,000 mock URLs.

## Importing Dataset
The dataset is stored in a JSON file, from which the URLs are extracted using parsing techniques. This JSON file serves as the primary repository for the extensive list of URLs.

## Sequential Search with Linked Lists
Sequential Search, augmented with linked lists, provides a versatile approach for traversing datasets. The linked list data structure ensures efficient traversal, making it suitable for examining URLs systematically, especially with growing datasets.

## Binary Search with Arrays
Binary Search is implemented with arrays, capitalizing on the sorted nature of the dataset. This approach swiftly narrows down the search space with each iteration, offering logarithmic time complexity and rapid search times, which is ideal for extensive datasets.

## Search by Hashing with Arrays and Maps
The search by hashing technique utilizes hash functions for indexing and retrieving URLs efficiently. Arrays enable direct access, while maps offer enhanced flexibility and adaptability, catering to various search scenarios.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the main program to execute the search algorithms.

## Usage
- Execute the main program to initiate search operations.
- Follow the prompts to select the desired search algorithm and input the URL index for retrieval.
